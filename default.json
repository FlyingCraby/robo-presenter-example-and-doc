{"introduction": "[distance 50 10]I made a cool presenter robot that helps present ideas to people. [led 1 flashing][led 2 flashing]It uses add-ons like LEDs, buttons, distance sensors, microphones, and speakers to interact with the audience. [led 1 on][led 2 off]The robot can detect and engage with the audience, say introductions, and talk to them.[led 2 off]\r\n\r\nI started with a basic version of the robot that only read scripts. But I wanted to make it more interactive, so I added a question and answer system, as well as AI engines like Wolfram Alpha and ChatGPT. I also developed a simple programming language that makes it easy to create powerful presentations. Press the button to continue. [button 10]\r\n\r\nDuring the development process, I encountered some issues, such as the limited number of pins on the Arduino board, flaky addon connections, and the need for a network connection. To address these problems, I used analog pins as digital pins, tested working codes, and created a graphical programming UI to make it even easier to use.\r\n\r\nOverall, my goal was to create an easy-to-use and programmable presenter robot that would help people present their ideas more effectively, especially in the context of science learning and the development of science expertise.", "qapair": [["What is the importance of hands-on models in science learning?", "According to Casselman et al.
