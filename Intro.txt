[voice Lucy] [led 1 flashing] Hello, I am Lucy.  Justin’s assistant.
[led 1 off] [voice Lucy] [led 1 flashing] You need to learn javascript, python, c plus plus, or scratch.

[led 1 off] [voice Lucy] [led 1 flashing] Sure…..  Please follow Justin’s pointer.
First, Justin wrote about this presentation in text embedded with annotations.  Text for subject knowledge and annotations for addon-ons as highlighted here. The QR code will show you more examples.
Next, I use ChatGPT to learn them through Prompt Engineering using frameworks like LangChain. 
Then I listen to the audience using voice recognition and use ChatGPT to generate answers in both text and annotations, not just repeating what Justin taught me.
Finally I have a state machine to translate the text to voice and interpret the annotations to drive add-ons [led 1 on] [motor fast] [relay on]

[voice Lucy] [led 1 flashing] When developing me, Justin had many challenges.  

First, there is no solution to run LangChain and vector data base on a Raspberry Pi a month ago. [wait 2] Until Justin worked with Active Loop, a company located in California two weeks ago. 

Second, ChartGPT is smart about general things, but it doesn’t know subject knowledge and news after 2021.  

Third, ChatGPT gives wrong answers, when it doesn’t have one.  This may be OK for chatting, but DEFINITELY not acceptable for education.  

 We don’t have much time to give details now, but we are happy to answer your questions or discuss them later.



[led 1 off] [voice Lucy] [led 1 flashing]: I’d like to speak languages other than English; help users to use add-ons; work without network; and fast upgrading
